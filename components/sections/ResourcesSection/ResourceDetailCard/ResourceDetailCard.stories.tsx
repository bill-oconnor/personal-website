      "Personal Knowledge Graph is a web app for visualizing, organizing, and integrating knowledge. Pieces of knowledge (blocks) live on their own, as opposed to within a rigid organizational structure, can be organized within a hierarchical topic structure, and can be linked to other blocks to demonstrate the connectedness and progression of knowledge (reference => summary => questions and conclusions => projects and expressions). WIP includes a dashboard with insights about the state of the knowledge, and tools for learning such as spaced repetition and forced recall aids",
