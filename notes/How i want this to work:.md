How i want this to work:

I create sections of the website and components in Next.js
I write blogs articles in Notion
I write blog metadata in Notion
I write content for website sections in Notion

What all do these templates offer?
Not using at first. want to learn for myself...

Need a Next JS site, then need to connect to notion, and need to organize notion as i should
